There is just one thing you need to notice:

when you change the `*.iso` to `*.raw`, imagewriter will not find it from gtk file selector. You just need copy the filename `*.raw` to the location. Then, just continue next.

But there is a critical problem:

It will finished unordinary, which will cause usb unmountable, when i restart computer and install os with this usb device. I can never use the usb device any more and when i try to format it, it only has 700MB space left instead of 2GB, i don't know why. Even though, i format it on windows 7, after this, it can be automatically mounted by linux, and i right click the device icon, select 'format', click 'Disk utils' and create new partition and format it.

It back! the 2GB space!

## Startup Disk Creator
