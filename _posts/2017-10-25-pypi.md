The Python Package Index is the official third-party software repository for Python. Some package managers, including pip, use PyPI as the default source for packages and their dependencies. [1][1] Twine is a utility for publishing Python packages on PyPI. It provides build system independent uploads of source and binary distribution artifacts for both new and existing projects. [2][2]
