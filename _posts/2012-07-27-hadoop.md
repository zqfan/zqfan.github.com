## What is Apache Hadoop?

The Apache™ Hadoop™ project develops open-source software for
reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
using a simple programming model. It is designed to scale up from
single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local
computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver
high-avaiability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle
failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-availabile
service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone
to failures.

## Single Point Failure

### dual-system hot backup

Facebook AvatarNode: active-active mode

1. hdfs client use virtual ip add to access AvatarNode
2. if primary AvatarNode fail, use standby AvatarNode
3. standby AvatarNode set access mode to safe mode (read-only), use
   NFS to merge FsImage and EditLog commited by primary AvatarNode,
   finally the virtual ip address is set to standby AvatarNode.

## Trouble Shoot

### ssh refuse

    apt-get install openssh-server
    ssh-keygen -t dsa -P "" -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa
    cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ssh localhost

### re-format filesystem aborted

hadoop namenode -format require a unexist dir, remove the prompt dir
rm -rf

### Does not contain a valid host:port authority

fs.default.name is not set correctly, for me, is just a type error
