## puppet node
[reference: node definition](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_node_definitions.html)

from the reference, i know how to use regular expression to indicate nodes

    node /^(foo|bar)\.example\.com$/ {
      include common
    }


## puppet scope
[reference: scope](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/scope_and_puppet.html)

from the reference, i konw how to use scope

    $var = "from topscope"
    node default {
      $var = "from node"
      include lookup_example
    }

    class lookup_example {
      notify { $var: }   # will be "from node"
      notify { $::var: } # will be "from topscope"
    }


## Puppet Require
I want to require a package on another class

    class foo {
        package { "bar": ensure => installed, }
    }
    class fooo {
        package { "barr":
            ensure => installed,
            require => Package["bar"],
        }
    }

This does not work, and `require => Class["foo"]` does not too. However, add a `include "foo"` in fooo works.

## how to use puppet tags
[reference: wiki](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Using_Tags)

[reference: 2.7 doc](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_tags.html)

if i did not assgin a tag to an agent, the agent will search the master's config for a node named `hostname` or 'default'. but if you give a tag for the agent, then it will search all resources have the tags.

### assgin a tag to agent

1. your hostname is a tag too
2. add tags when you run `puppet agent`

    $ puppetd --tags webserver,ftpserver

3. add tags option in puppet.conf

    # cat /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
    tags = webserver, ftpserver

### add a tag to resource

1. tag => webserver
2. for class, add tag("webserver")
3. in fact, all node, class and define has a automatical generated tag, it's their name exactly


## how to use puppet kick
see the `puppet kick --help` first, the `USAGE NOTES` says:

    Puppet kick is useless unless puppet agent is listening for incoming
    connections and allowing access to the `run` endpoint. This entails
    starting the agent with `listen = true` in its puppet.conf file, and
    allowing access to the `/run` path in its auth.conf file; see
    `http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/rest_auth_conf.html` for more
    details.

    Additionally, due to a known bug, you must make sure a
    namespaceauth.conf file exists in puppet agent's $confdir. This file
    will not be consulted, and may be left empty.

NOTE: all the following steps must run by root or sudo
### step 1
to enable listen conf, add the following line in /etc/puppet/puppet.conf in your puppet slave

    [agent]
    listen=true

or you can run command by:

    # augtool << EOF
    set /files/etc/puppet/puppet.conf/agent/listen true
    save
    EOF

### step 2
to allow access to the /run path, you should edit /etc/puppet/auth.conf in your puppet slave
    
    path /run
    auth any
    method save
    allow master.puppet.com

    # this one is not stricly necessary, but it has the merit
    # to show the default policy which is deny everything else
    path /
    auth any

note puppet-master.puppet.com must be add in the /etc/hosts entry
### step 3
add a empty file on your puppet slave

    # touch /etc/puppet/namespaceauth.conf

### step 4
to test the `puppet kick`, on puppet slave node, run `puppet agent --debug --verbose --no-daemonize`, on puppet master node, run `puppet kick --foreground --debug --host slave.puppet.com`. plz not that you should add entry on your /etc/hosts of slave.puppet.com

NOTE: 1) The --tag option is a decorader to object, you can not just specify tag without host class. 

NOTE: 2) That puppet listen on 8139, please let firewall allow that port.


## ldap  <=== this section is not completed
[reference: ldap nodes](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/Ldap_Nodes)

[reference: openldap quick guide](http://www.blogjava.net/kapok/archive/2005/05/05/4034.html)


### step 1
Install ldap server

    # apt-get install slapd ldap-utils
    # wget https://raw.github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/master/ext/ldap/puppet.schema
    # cp puppet.schema /etc/ldap/schema/
    
Add a include puppet.schema line in /usr/share/slapd/slapd.conf

    include         /etc/ldap/schema/core.schema
    include         /etc/ldap/schema/cosine.schema
    include         /etc/ldap/schema/nis.schema
    include         /etc/ldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
    include         /etc/ldap/schema/puppet.schema

The reference tells me to restart the server, i did it, but i don't know if it is necessary. Maybe you can try this:

    # sudo /etc/init.d/ldap start

Add a default node in your LDAP
    
    # cat test.ldif
    dn: cn=default,dc=orgName,dc=com
    objectClass: device
    objectClass: puppetClient
    objectClass: top
    cn: default
    # ldapadd -x -f test.ldif

The last command seems failed because of "ldap_add: Invalid syntax (21)"
### step 2
Install ldap ruby binding for puppet master

    # apt-get install ruby-ldap

Check it

    # ruby -rldap -e 'puts :installed'
    installed
    # ruby -rpuppet -e 'p Puppet.features.ldap?'
    true

Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf

    [puppetmasterd]
    node_terminus = ldap
    ldapserver = ldapserver.yourdomain.com
    ldapbase = dc=puppet

Add a empty default node in your site.pp

    node default {}


## Common Issues

### SSL

    warning: Certificate validation failed; consider using the certname configuration option
    err: Could not retrieve catalog: Certificates were not trusted: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed

Add certname on puppet.conf, cert server domain is pointed to master.puppet.com or you can use master.puppet.com directly.

    [master]
    certname=cert.puppet.com

[reference](https://wiki.koumbit.net/PuppetMasterDebianInstall)

NOTE: `puppetca clean --all` and remove /var/lib/puppet/ssl will not work
