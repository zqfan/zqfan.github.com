## steven purcell's emacs.d

someone says his emacs.d is the world wide best, so i just try it, however, i couldn't use it.

1. git clone from purcell/emacs.d.git
1. rm ~/.emacs && cd ~/.emacs.d
1. git submodule update --init
1. emacs &

the first step is use org as my gtd tool, i already use emacs org mode for gtd for almost one year, i know how to set it directly through some \*.el file, but i don't know how to config it gracefully via purcell's emacs.d, which means, i don't want to change it, just want edit some extra files in the .emacs.d dir.

any idea?

here comes a bad idea:

i insert a line in emacs.d/init-org.el

    (setq org-agenda-files (quote ("~/private/gtd/")))

ugly...
