## uninstall via OS package manager

Cannot uninstall 'pyparsing'. It is a distutils installed project and
thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which
would lead to only a partial uninstall.

solution (centos):

```
yum list | grep pyparsing
yum remove pyparsing
```

## python3 pip3

```
$ pip3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip3", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name 'main' from 'pip' (/opt/python3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip/__init__.py)
```

It is caused by Debain system, so Ubuntu will be affected as well. Use `python3 -m pip install PACKAGE_NAME` instead.

Or you can edit `/usr/bin/pip3`, change code from

```
from pip import main
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main.main())
```

to

```
from pip import __main__
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(__main__._main())
```
